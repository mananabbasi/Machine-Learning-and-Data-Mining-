This repository focuses on Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining, leveraging Python libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, 
and Scikit-learn to analyze and extract insights from textual data. The projects cover techniques such as tokenization,
sentiment classification, topic modeling, and keyword extraction, providing practical examples to understand and process
text data effectively. Whether you're analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, or any text corpus, these tools and 
scripts offer a comprehensive starting point. Feel free to explore, adapt, and apply the code to your own datasets!
Happy text mining
